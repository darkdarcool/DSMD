# DSMD

> Better Markdown

Hello! And welcome to DSMD! DSMD is a powerful markdown superset the superpowers markdown to allow you to make:

* Comments

* Chosen rendering

* A local DSMD to markdown transpiler, so you can make DSMD your projects README.md

* Via [Markdown-it](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it), we are able to compile your DSMD to HTMl!

* So much more to come!


And to use DSMD, all you have to do is install it via NPM! Let's get started!

# Installation

To install DSMD, copy paste the following into your project: 

``` shell
 npm i dsmd
```

And you have just installed DSMD into your project! \* Pat yourself on the back \*

But wait, we're no done yet! We havent' actually _done_ anything with DSMD yet besides installing it! So make a `dsmd.js` file, and let's write some code!

Copy paste the following into your file:

``` javascript
 var DSMD = require("dsmd");
 console.log(DSMD.toMarkdown(". (Hello, world!"))); // => Hello, world!
```

Fun right! You have just used DSMD! And you can edit the string of DSMD in any way you like!

You can also transpile DSMD to HTML using the `toHTML` function as well

And you have offically used DSMD!

# Conclusion

Thank you for reading the DSMD readme, DSMD is very new and is still in the works and will probably get changed a lot, so be on the lookout for that. Thank you so much, and I hope we cross paths again!

> Fun fact: This entire MD was built in DSMD!
